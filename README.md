Designing a Home Automation system using Arduino and sensors

An off-the-shelf ready made Arduino BT is an 8-bit
microcontroller board based on the ATmega168 and the
Bluegiga WT11 Bluetooth module [11] is used. It supports
wireless serial communication over Bluetooth. This board
has 23 digital input and output ports, 16kB of flash
memory, 10-bit analog to digital converter, pulse width
modulator and extra hardware resources which makes it
suitable for the required task. The Arduino BT board can
be programmed wirelessly over the Bluetooth connection
using the microcontrollerâ€Ÿs high-level interactive C
language
